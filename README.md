# Discord-Bot-Template
This is a basic project for developing a discord bot based on the discord.js packages.  Done in javascript and contains samples of functionalities...

  <li>If sounds do not play correctly, please also do: <b>"npm i ffmpeg-static"</b></li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Updates</h2>
Because this is merely a template, everything is bare as possible. I will, however, update with comments and any other features I come up with later on and will
do my best to document it properly. Thank you for looking at this project; if any questions or issues, feel free to email me at jaymcariaga@gmail.com
